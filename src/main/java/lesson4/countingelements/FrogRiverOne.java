/**
 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially
 * located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the
 * opposite bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the
 * river.
 * <p>
 * You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling
 * leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured
 * in seconds.
 * <p>
 * The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other
 * side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every
 * position across the river from 1 to X (that is, we want to find the earliest
 * moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves). You may
 * assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e.
 * the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.
 * <p>
 * For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1<br>
 * A[1] = 3<br>
 * A[2] = 1<br>
 * A[3] = 4<br>
 * A[4] = 2<br>
 * A[5] = 3<br>
 * A[6] = 5<br>
 * A[7] = 4<br>
 * In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when
 * leaves appear in every position across the river.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }<br>
 * that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X,
 * returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the
 * river.
 * <p>
 * If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the
 * function should return âˆ’1.
 * <p>
 * For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1<br>
 * A[1] = 3<br>
 * A[2] = 1<br>
 * A[3] = 4<br>
 * A[4] = 2<br>
 * A[5] = 3<br>
 * A[6] = 5<br>
 * A[7] = 4<br>
 * the function should return 6, as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];
 * <li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].
 * </ul>
